      ABOUT ME
      Hey visitor!  My name is Matt and I am a web developer currently based in NJ.

This wasnâ€™t always the case, however.  I knew for the longest time, I always had an interest in people and how they work together in the different places in society.  I previously had attended the University of Delaware for Business Administration, only to find that it was not destined for me.  But what came from it, was an opportunity to pursue and receive an Associates in Sociology from my local community college.  But life can be funny sometimes, you know?  All this career searching had lead me to two realizations.

The first? Sociology had become an integral part of my life, changing how I viewed many aspects of life and how I interfaced with them.

The second? Being an avid video gamer and constant internet user through the years practically lead me to a new part of my life into web development. I went on to receive education in a bunch of awesome web technologies!

So here I am.  My name is Matt, I love to talk about society and the relationships of people in communities.  I found that web development is an extremely rewarding experience and also allows me to express my love of sociology in a world of connected people using new technologies. Feel free to look around!
